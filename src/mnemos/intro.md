# MnemOS

[MnemOS](https://mnemos.jamesmunns.com) is my hobby/research OS, aimed at running on constrained devices like Microcontrollers or smaller Microprocessors.

It aims to bridge the gap between restrictive bare-metal/RTOS environments, and "full featured" operating systems like Embedded Linux.

This section is for areas of research relevant to MnemOS, or using MnemOS as a research platform.
